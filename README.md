# Instructions for setup
## Step 1: Download MATLAB Runtime 
The MATLAB Runtime is a standalone set of shared libraries that enables the execution of compiled MATLAB applications or components. Note, however, that the Runtime file is quite large (1.5-1.7GB)
**Right-Click on this link and open in a new tab:** https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html <br>
As shown below, open the *R2019a (9.6) version suited to your platform (Mac, Windows, or Linux)

- Follow steps for installation.

## Step 3: Download the cLBT.zip file
**Right-Click on this link and open in a new tab:** [Line Bisection Test App](https://github.com/rinivarg/cLBT/blob/master/acquisition/cLBT.zip) <br>

Note that some computers are set up to automatically unzip the downloaded file. If so, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, unzip the file.

## Step 4: The app is ready for use.
