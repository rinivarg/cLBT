## Step 1: Download MATLAB Runtime 
- The MATLAB Runtime is a FREE standalone set of shared libraries that enables the execution of compiled MATLAB applications or components. <br>
- Note that the Runtime file is quite large (1.7-2 GB).<br>
- **Right-Click on this link and open in a new tab:** https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html <br>
- As shown below, download the *R2019a (9.6)* version suited to your platform (Mac, Windows, or Linux)<br>
	<img src="images/mcr_version_img.png" width = "700">

## Step 2: Install the MATLAB Runtime
- Double-Click on the downloaded MATLAB Runtime file from your *Downloads* folder. 
	<img src="images/install_mcr.png" width = "500">
- Follow steps for installation.

## Step 3: Download the cLBT.zip file
- **Right-Click on this link and open in a new tab:** [Line Bisection Test App](https://github.com/rinivarg/cLBT/blob/master/acquisition/cLBT.zip) <br>
	<img src="images/dwld_zip.png" width = "700">
- This file is approximately 23 MB
- Note that some computers are set up to automatically unzip the downloaded file. If so, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, unzip the file.

## Step 4: The app is ready for use. 
- The thumbnail for the app looks like this: <br>
	<img src="images/app_tn.png" width = "70"> <br>
- Open and follow instructions!

## Note:
- When you open the app, if you see a message like below due to your computer's firewall settings, please click ***Cancel***: <br>
	<img src="images/firewall_msg.png" width = "500"> <br>

- Then, similar to other apps that you might use, please grant permission to open the app by going to Settings or System Preferences. <br> 
On a Mac, you can go to	*System Preferences > Security & Privacy* and clicking on ***Open Anyway*** <br>
	<img src="images/open_anyway.png" width = "500"> <br>
	
- In the message box, confirm by clicking ***Open***. You will only need to grant this permission on the first use.

# How to administer the test?
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary><br>
	
1) **Screen:** It is recommended to use a screen that is at least 15" in size and is placed 2 feet away (depending on the size of your screen).
3) **Hand:** Use the right (or left) hand. It is advisable to use the hand which you think is proficient at using the computer mouse. Stroke surviovrs use their less-weaker hand. The other hand must rest on the lap.
2) **Mouse:** It is recommended to use a wired or wireless mouse to use the pen tool instead of the trackpad of a laptop. Press and hold the left mouse key to activate the pen tool. Wait for the crosshairs to appear before you begin.
4) **Instructions:** Must include the following elements:
	- For each horizontal line in half by drawing a small vertical line through each line as close to its center as possible. 
	- You are only allowed a single try per line. Try to be as accurate as you can.
	- Mark on every line the best you can, without skipping.
	- Do not move the screen closer or to any one side.

1) Open the app. Note that sometimes the app takes a few seconds to open up. Please be patient.
2) You should see a *Welcome* message.
3) After you click **OK**, a dialog box appears asking for 3 required inputs:<br>
		<img src="images/data_name.png" width = "200"><br>
		(1) **Enter an appropriate ID.**
			This ID will be the Participant ID in your data output file. <br>
		(2) **Enter Gender.**
			Use a single letter: M (Male), F (Female), or N (Not disclosed). <br>
		(3) **Enter Number of Trials.**
			You can use any whole number starting from 1. 
			It is advisable to use at least 10 trials, but you can use more.
			Click **OK**. <br><br>
4) Next, you will be prompted to ***Select*** a location to save your output files. 
		<img src="images/output_fld.png" width = "400"><br><br>
5) Once you have selected your desired location, you will see the instructions for the task:<br>
		<img src="images/instr.png" width = "500"><br><br>
6) You will now see the first trial for the line bisection. Wait for the cross-hairs to appear (see below) before you mark the midpoint of the horizontal line. Note that the horizontal line will appear in different quadrants of the screen.<br>
		<img src="images/crosshair.png" width = "400"><br><br>
7) Draw a short vertical line to indicate your response (see below):<br>
		<img src="images/mrkd_trial.png" width = "400"><br><br>
8) After you have completed all the trials, you will see a summary figure (see below) and a *Thank you* message.<br>
		<img src="images/summ_fig.png" width = "300"><br><br>
9) Your output data folder is saved on your *Desktop* with the following name: **LBT_[yourID_yourGender]**<br>
10) The app will close when you close these windows.

# What does the output folder contain?
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary><br>
	
The output folder saved within the *Desktop* folder and contains the following files: <br>
- **00a_LBT_summary.tiff**<br>This is the summary image file that you see at the end of the test.<br>
- **00b_Average_Report_LBT_[yourID_yourGender].txt**<br>This file contains the average absolute and percent deviation across all trials. It also contains the total time taken to complete the test (in seconds). <br>
- **00b_TrialWise_Report_LBT_[yourID_yourGender].txt**<br>This file containts the trial-wise absolute (in a.u.) and percent deviations across all trials. The trial-wise file also outputs two additional variables: WorkspaceX and WorkspaceY. These two variables define the quadrant in which the line appeared. For example, ***left*** (WorkspaceX) and ***bottom*** (WorkspaceY).<br>
- **LBT_[yourID_yourGender].mat**<br>Contains raw trial-wise data with x and y cursor position data. Note that you will only be able to open this file if you have MATLAB installed on your machine.<br>
- **log_[mm-dd-yyyy-hh-mm].txt**<br>Log file containing outputs from the MATLAB command window. Will contain any errors in running the app. If no errors, it will report the average and standard deviation info.<br>
- **LBT_[yourID_yourGender_trial#].jpeg**<br> Low-res image files for each trial showing participant performance.
